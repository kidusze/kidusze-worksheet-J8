1. Functional requirements specify concrete actions the system should perform, like adding a specific feature that produces a result when used. Non-functional requirements, on the other hand, focus on performance aspects, like querying a database and ensuring it returns a result within a set time to meet speed and reliability standards.

2. A functional requirement for Instagram could involve accurately updating the count of comments and likes on a post whenever a user interacts with it. Another requirement could be to adjust the follower count in real-time when a user clicks the "follow" or "unfollow" button on a profile.

3. A non-functional requirement might set specific standards for the appearance of the bio section, like font size and style . It could also be the app icon's color scheme and resolution to meet brand standards and compatibility across devices.

5. Getting the complete requirements at the beginning of the development cycle is not realistic so an agile model allows to gain the complete requirements for a small chunk of the code which will reduce the number of changes to be made later in the development cycle.
